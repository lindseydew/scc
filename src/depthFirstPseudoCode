Algorithm: depthFirstMatrix (adjMatrix, n)
Input: A graph's adjacency matrix, number of vertices n.

     // Visit order will start with "0", so initialize to -1.
1.   for i=0 to n-1
2.       visitOrder[i] = -1
3.   endfor

     // A counter for the order:
4.   visitCount = -1

     // Look for an unvisited vertex and explore its tree.
     // We need this because the graph may have multiple components.
5.   for i=0 to n-1
6.       if visitOrder[i] < 0
7.         depthFirstMatrixRecursive (i)
8.       endif
9.   endfor
